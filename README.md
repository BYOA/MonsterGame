# MonsterGame
A simple game using 2d arrays. Get to the treasure but don't get caught!


## Rules

1. Each turn you are able to move either up, down, left or right using the WASD keys.
2. Avoid 'T' symbols. They represent enemies. If you touch the enemy, you will be caught!
3. Reach to the treasure marked at 'X' and steal the enemies treasure!
